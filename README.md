# CAMSAT clustering for speaker recognition/verification

This repository is for our paper entitled "CAMSAT: Augmentation Mix and Self-Augmented Training Clustering for Self-Supervised Speaker Recognition" currently under review.

Code of our experiments as well as all pseudo-labels will be available upon acceptance of our paper.
